SONAR ROCK VS MINE PREDICTION (BINARY SUPERVISED LEARNING)

🪨 Sonar Mine vs Rock Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to classify objects as either mines or rocks based on sonar signals. The dataset contains 60 features representing sonar energy readings at various angles, which are used to train a Logistic Regression classifier.

🔍 Project Objective
To develop a binary classification model that can distinguish between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder (mine) or a rock using Logistic Regression, one of the most interpretable and widely used classification algorithms.

4.Sklearn

🔄 Workflow
1.Load Dataset
  Load and inspect the dataset, check for nulls or inconsistencies.

2.Data Preprocessing
  Encode categorical labels (R, M) into numerical format.
  Normalize or scale features if needed.

3.Train-Test Split
  Split data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 ratio).

4.Model Training
  Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.

5.Evaluation
  Use accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  Evaluate using test data to ensure generalization.

6.Prediction
  Allow user input to test custom sonar readings and predict the output class.

📈 Results
Achieved a good level of accuracy on unseen data.
Demonstrated clear separation between classes using logistic regression.
